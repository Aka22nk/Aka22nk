## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently in my fourth year of pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering with a specialization in Cybersecurity at Pillai HOC College of Engineering and Technology. Cybersecurity, which involves protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, has become a critical field in todayâ€™s technology-driven world. My academic background, combined with practical training, has equipped me with foundational knowledge in areas such as network security, ethical hacking, encryption, and risk assessment.

I also have a strong academic record and technical proficiency in Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS, along with hands-on experience in software development, data warehousing, and cloud platforms. I am seeking an internship opportunity to apply my skills in a dynamic and innovative environment. I am particularly eager to further strengthen my expertise in both cybersecurity and system design while learning from experienced professionals and contributing to impactful projects.
